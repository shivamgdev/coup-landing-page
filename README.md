## Tech Stack Used

- **React (Vite)**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**

---

## Design & Implementation Notes

- The desktop layout (1920×1080) was implemented pixel-perfect as per the Figma design.
- Responsive behavior was added using Tailwind CSS breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
- Decorative elements (birds, clouds) are conditionally hidden on smaller screens to maintain a clean mobile UX.
- CSS keyframe animations were used for flying birds to keep the implementation lightweight and performant.
- Absolute positioning was used intentionally to match the design layout accurately.

---

## Assumptions

- Decorative animations are hidden on mobile devices for better performance and clarity.
- Assets provided via Figma were assumed to be final and optimized.
- This project focuses on UI implementation only; no backend functionality is included.
